            <!-- Add a paragraph describing what web apps do and how they interact with databases and display it to the user -->
            <p> 
                Web applications interact with backend databases through a client-server architecture. 
                <br>The web application (client) sends requests to the server, which hosts the backend database. 
                <br>The server processes these requests, performing operations such as retrieving, updating, or deleting data. I
                <br>then sends the response back to the client, allowing the web application to display updated information. 
                <br>Technologies involved in this process include SQL databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL), NoSQL databases (e.g., MongoDB), 
                <br>and server-side scripting languages (e.g., PHP, Python, Node.js).
            </p>
            <!-- Add a paragraph describing intranet in business cases and how they interact with databases and display it to the user -->
            <p>
                In businesses, intranet use cases include employee portals for internal communication, document management systems, 
                <br>and HR management tools, where web applications interact with backend databases to store and retrieve employee information, 
                <br>documents, and organizational data securely within the company network. On the internet, e-commerce platforms, 
                <br>customer relationship management (CRM) systems, and online banking are common use cases, where web applications 
                <br>connect to backend databases to manage product inventories, customer data, and financial transactions, providing 
                <br>real-time updates and seamless user experiences. These interactions typically involve client-server architecture, 
                <br>where web applications send requests to servers hosting the databases, which process the requests and return the 
                <br>necessary data to the client.
